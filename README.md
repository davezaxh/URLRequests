## URLRequests

You might have seen this version of code in many repos, but this is my version of the same with a few minor tweaks. The following documentation specifies the language 
and libraries used to build this project.

### Language : [**Python**](https://www.python.org/)

### Libraries Used : [optparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html), [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html), [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html), [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Required Packages
Before you use this program, you would need to install the required libraries as mentioned above and can be done using the following command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage : 

```
python3 urlrequests.py --link https://bit.ly/ProfileGitHub --time 25 
```
					
### Documentation 

This a project which enables you to send requests to a certain URL either at a fixed interval of time or random interval of time by using the *requests* library.
Depending on the type of URL you must specify the contents of the [*headers*](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-headers/), for instance URLs from URLShorteners 
such as [*bit.ly*](https://bit.ly) require header contents as follows: 
```
'Content-Type': 'text/html',
'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/95.0.4638.69 Safari/537.36' 
```
but for other URLs, you can get away without specifying them. 

It also utilizes the other libraries such as *optparse*  to parse the options provided during command execution. The other libraries include
the *time* library to provide time intervals between each requests, it's a necessary evil required to prevent abuse the provided URLs. Last, but not the least it utilizes
*random* library to generate a time interval between *5-30* seconds incase the time interval is not specified.

Just a word of caution, if the time inteval is specified **manually** be sure 
to give a *minimum* of **5** seconds of time interval between each request. You can also change the *User-Agent* based on your liking. The help menu can be used as follows:

```
python3 urlrequests.py --help 

Output:
Usage: shortener.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help             show this help message and exit
  -l LINK, --link=LINK  [Required] Used to specify a link for sending requests
  -t TIME, --time=TIME  [Optional] Used to specify the time interval between
                        each request
If time is not specified, a random time interval
between 5 to 30 seconds would be selected between each request.
Example: python3 urlrequests.py --link https://bit.ly/ProfileGitHub --time 20

```

Hope you found this project useful, if you have any queries feel free to raise an issue or contact me using the above-mentioned means! 

### Future Imporvements:

- To be able to provide custom *User-Agent* via the execution command.
- Add an option for specifying a time interval for the random time-interval option.
- Further House-Keeping & Beautification of Code.
